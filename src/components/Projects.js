          village dairy. The Rural area people can not fill or send their cattle
          Dairydirectly to dairy. The Dairy management have many franchisees at
          all small villages so people can give their Dairyat franchisees and
          dairy management collect the Dairyfrom franchisees daily. Our software

          Automatic Personality Identification using Machine Learning
        </h5>
        <p class="card-text">
          Machine learning has led to important advances in society. One of the
          most exciting applications of machine learning in psychological
          science has been the development of assessment tools that can
          powerfully predict human behavior and personality traits. Thus far,
          machine learning approaches to personality assessment have been
          focused on the associations between social media and other digital
          records with established personality measures. The goal of this paper
          is to expand the potential of machine learning approaches to
          personality assessment by embedding it in a more comprehensive
          construct validation framework. We review recent applications of
          machine learning to personality assessment, place machine learning
          research in the broader context of fundamental principles of construct
          validation and provide recommendations for how to use machine learning
          to advance our understanding of personality.

        <p class="card-text">
          Objective of this software project is to create a website which can
          host online music store and provide user’s quality music online. As
          internet is getting popular, this website provides online music store
          which can be accessed from anywhere, anytime. • This project intends
          to introduce more user friendliness in the various activities such as
          record maintenance and searching. • The searching of record has been
          made quite simple as all the details of the music album can be
          obtained by simply keying in few keywords. • All information is stored
          electronically in database and only accessible to authorized users of
          the system. • Administrators of website can create reports to see
          performance of their business and take corrective action’s based on
          results.
